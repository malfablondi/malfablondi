## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
## My Name is Mubarik Alfablondi

- ðŸ’¬ About Me: I would describe myself as a workacholiac whenever I get free time for myself. I'm currently learning everything I can when it involves tech. specifically in the Hardware and Software field of things. Most importantly my github is towards displaying my skills with data, a.i, and how to impliment that in the real world. I'd say a real world physical api interwoven with tech and real life.
